            <div class="subtitle">Deep Work: What I Chose After Trying Various Time Management Apps</div>
        </div>

        <img src="assets/generative/cloud1.png" alt="Deep Work and Time Management" class="cover-image">

        <article class="article">
            <p class="cn">本文将介绍两个帮助我拥有更多深度工作的工具，一个独立的计时器和一张A5的白纸。它们很简单、很原始，但这是在我试过各种时间管理APP、清单APP、日程本后觉得最有效的方式。这两个工具帮我更有意识地使用时间，拥有更多专注的时光，更好地满足自己的需求，更少拖延，完成了很多困难的事情，更少因为虚度时光而自责，更平和、更有幸福感地生活。</p>
            <p class="en">This article will introduce two tools that have helped me achieve more deep work: a standalone timer and an A5 sheet of paper. They are simple, primitive even, but I've found them to be the most effective approach after trying various time management apps, list apps, and planners. These tools have helped me use time more consciously, enjoy more focused hours, better meet my needs, procrastinate less, accomplish difficult tasks, feel less guilty about wasted time, and live more peacefully and happily.</p>

            <p class="cn">我使用独立的计时器和A5白纸的方式非常简单——在纸上写下今天想做的事，在开始深度工作的时候使用计时器进行计时并记录花了多长时间，每完成一项就打个勾，脑子里突然冒出来一个待办就迅速写在纸上，这看起来实在没有什么特别的。但就是用这个简单的办法，我做完了几个拖了很久的高难度项目，也投入了更多时间去做我喜欢的事情。</p>
            <p class="en">My use of the standalone timer and A5 paper is remarkably simple - I write down what I want to do today on the paper, use the timer to track time when I start deep work and record how long it takes, check off items as I complete them, and quickly jot down any new tasks that pop into my mind. There's nothing particularly special about this approach. Yet using this simple method, I've completed several challenging projects that I had been putting off for a long time and invested more time in doing things I love.</p>

            <p class="cn">先谈谈独立的计时器。我强调"独立"是因为我不推荐手机、电脑上的计时器。你需要一个实体的、具备基础的正计时功能的计时器，其中正计时的操作要直接——按一下开始计时、再按一下停止计时。此外，我推荐选择可以连续计时若干个小时的计时器，不推荐只能计时几十分钟的计时器。满足上述要求的计时器在网上十块左右就能搞定。</p>
            <p class="en">Let's first discuss the standalone timer. I emphasize "standalone" because I don't recommend timers on phones or computers. You need a physical timer with basic counting-up functionality, where starting and stopping time is straightforward - one press to start, another to stop. Additionally, I recommend choosing a timer that can count continuously for several hours, rather than one limited to just a few dozen minutes. A timer meeting these requirements can be found online for around ten yuan.</p>

            <p class="cn">为什么需要用一个独立的计时器呢？我过去也常用电子设备内置的计时器或者各种番茄钟功能、种树功能的APP（如forest），但这有四个问题。</p>
            <p class="en">Why do we need a standalone timer? In the past, I often used built-in timers on electronic devices or apps with features like Pomodoro timers or tree-planting functions (such as Forest), but these presented four problems.</p>

            <p class="cn">第一，交互不够直接。在手机上使用计时功能大约有如下几个步骤：找到手机→找到APP→找到正计时功能→开始计时。而一个独立的计时器可以固定放在我的工作桌上，不需要找，使用正计时功能最多按几下切换模式的键，就可以开始计时了，这相比于在满屏幕的手机APP中找到需要的那个APP要方便多了。</p>
            <p class="en">First, the interaction isn't direct enough. Using a timer function on a phone typically involves several steps: find the phone → find the app → locate the count-up function → start timing. A standalone timer can be fixed on my work desk, requires no searching, and needs at most a few button presses to switch modes and start timing. This is much more convenient than finding a specific app among countless phone applications.</p>

            <p class="cn">第二，容易分心。使用手机计时很有可能在寻找APP、准备开始计时的途中被一个弹出的消息截了胡，等回过神来，大把时光已经悄悄溜走了（时间："溜了溜了。"）。</p>
            <p class="en">Second, it's easy to get distracted. When using a phone timer, you're likely to be intercepted by a pop-up notification while searching for the app or preparing to start timing, and before you know it, precious time has silently slipped away (Time: "I'm out of here!").</p>

            <p class="cn">第三，占用大脑内存。使用手机、电脑上的计时器的一个重要问题是容易忘记停止计时，这也是交互不直接导致的。因为计时APP需要我主动调出来才能出现在眼前，所以为了不忘记这件事，我得分一部分脑力出来提醒自己别忘了停止计时，这相当于浪费掉了本可以投入工作的那部分脑力资源。但是独立的计时器就不一样了，它交互直接，不会弹出消息打扰你，而且个头不小，放在桌上就在你眼前晃，很容易就能看到，相当于它会主动提醒你要停止计时。用独立的计时器时，我不咋刻意提醒自己要停止计时，但是确实很少忘记，毕竟它是我桌上的"显眼包"。</p>
            <p class="en">Third, it occupies mental RAM. A significant issue with phone or computer timers is that it's easy to forget to stop timing, which is also a result of indirect interaction. Since timer apps need to be actively pulled up to be visible, I have to allocate some mental energy to remind myself not to forget to stop timing, essentially wasting brain power that could be invested in work. But a standalone timer is different - its interaction is direct, it won't pop up notifications to disturb you, and it's sizeable enough to be visible on your desk, actively reminding you to stop timing. With a standalone timer, I rarely consciously remind myself to stop timing, yet I seldom forget, as it's the "obvious package" on my desk.</p>

            <p class="cn">第四，影响心情。我不知道大家有没有类似的体验，我在使用电子设备的时候会有一种细微的焦虑感，因而会有点细微的抗拒使用电子设备的情绪。这或许是因为，在现代社会，这是一种我想离开却又离开不了的东西，而且它还在以一种无孔不入的方式不断侵占我生活的领地。或许在潜意识层面我有一种被捆绑的不自由感，因此想要逃离电子生活。而我和计时器的关系则很友好，使用它时我心里很平静。</p>
            <p class="en">Fourth, it affects mood. I don't know if others have similar experiences, but I feel a subtle anxiety when using electronic devices, which creates a slight resistance to using them. Perhaps this is because, in modern society, these are things I want to leave behind but can't, and they continue to invade every aspect of my life in an all-pervasive way. Perhaps at a subconscious level, I feel a sense of being bound and unfree, making me want to escape electronic life. However, my relationship with the timer is friendly, and I feel peaceful when using it.</p>

            <p class="cn">另一个操作细节是我只对深度工作进行计时，当我要处理一些临时的浅工作时我会暂停计时，比如回消息、用手机浏览网页等。这么做可以在心理上形成一种隐形的约束，避免注意力的漂移：现在计时器开着呢，我需要让它只统计深度工作，所以现在不能碰手机。这层隐形的约束会捕获那些本来将无意识地走向分心的时刻，提醒我有意识地把注意力拉回当下的工作中。</p>
            <p class="en">Another operational detail is that I only time deep work, pausing the timer when I need to handle temporary shallow work like responding to messages or browsing the web on my phone. This creates an invisible psychological constraint that helps prevent attention drift: with the timer running, I need to keep it counting only deep work time, so I can't touch my phone now. This invisible constraint captures moments that would have unconsciously led to distraction, reminding me to consciously bring my attention back to the current work.</p>

            <p class="cn">下面来谈谈我为什么要使用计时器，它有什么好处。</p>
            <p class="en">Let's discuss why I use a timer and its benefits.</p>

            <p class="cn">第一，它可以帮助我克服拖延，完成困难的任务。拖延的卡点很多时候在于事情的启动，而不在于做事的过程。而难以启动很多时候不是因为事情真实的难度，而是因为对未知的恐惧，因为不了解这个事的具体情况而扩大化地想象了事情的难度。当你一旦开始上手做事，就能对这个事儿心里有点底，配合上计时器，你就能知道每一个步骤具体需要多长时间，它可能远比你想象的要短。使用计时器帮我意识到，有大量大量的事情，只要开始做十分钟、半小时，我就能拨开大部分迷雾，看到一个大概的行动路径，我就会更有信心和动力做下去了。借助计时器，曾经模糊的、遥不可及的目标就变成了做十分钟、半小时就大概率能得到初步解决的事情。这种体会多了，就真的能在自己身上建立一种心理势能，面对任何一件事都能以"不过就是半小时的事吗"的轻松态度来应对，没在怕的。信心意味着行动力，很多时候解决了信心的问题，事情就解决了一大半。因此，按下计时器开始键的瞬间，就像在给发动机打火，咱们现在就是一个蓄势待发的节奏。</p>
            <p class="en">First, it helps me overcome procrastination and complete difficult tasks. The sticking point in procrastination often lies in starting things rather than in the process of doing them. The difficulty in starting is often not due to the task's actual difficulty, but fear of the unknown, magnifying the task's difficulty through imagination because we don't understand its specific situation. Once you start working on something, you begin to get a sense of it, and with the timer, you can know exactly how long each step takes - it might be far shorter than you imagined. Using the timer has helped me realize that for many tasks, just ten minutes or half an hour of work can clear away most of the fog and reveal a general path of action, giving me more confidence and motivation to continue. With the timer's help, previously vague, seemingly unreachable goals become tasks that can likely be initially resolved in ten minutes or half an hour. As this experience accumulates, it builds a psychological momentum where you can approach any task with the relaxed attitude of "it's just a half-hour thing." Confidence means action power - often, when you solve the confidence problem, you've solved half the battle. Therefore, the moment you press the timer's start button is like igniting an engine, putting us in a ready-to-go state.</p>

            <p class="cn">计时器除了能帮我建立一种应对不同事情的广义的信心，也能帮我针对具体的事建立具体的信心。比如我最近完成了一个有点复杂的写作项目，我本来一直拖着不想做。因为使用了计时器，我知道了原来写初稿、修改到一个满意的版本、反复校对整个过程只要16个小时。这样下次再做类似的事情的时候，我就不再是"啊不知道从何写起，好难啊"，而是"如果我现在开始写，总计16个小时可以完成"。计时器帮助我把对这个写作项目的认知从模糊的"看似要无穷久"变成了具体的"16个小时"。通过收集真实的数据，我们可以对未来做出更准确的预测。</p>
            <p class="en">Beyond helping build general confidence in handling different tasks, the timer also helps establish specific confidence for particular tasks. For example, I recently completed a somewhat complex writing project that I had been putting off. Because I used the timer, I learned that the entire process - writing the first draft, revising to a satisfactory version, and repeated proofreading - only took 16 hours. So the next time I face a similar task, instead of thinking "I don't know where to start, it's so hard," I can think "if I start now, I can complete it in 16 hours total." The timer helped transform my perception of this writing project from a vague "seems to take forever" to a concrete "16 hours." By collecting real data, we can make more accurate predictions for the future.</p>

            <p class="cn">第二，它可以帮我更客观地了解我每天的深度工作时间，帮我认可自己每天的努力。如果你也是个容易对自己有点苛刻的人，常因为觉得又虚度了一天的光阴而拷问自己，那么计时器或许会对你很有帮助。很多时候这种自我责备是由偏离事实的想法造成的，而不是事实本身造成的。前面我提到要在一张纸上写下想做的事，并对其中的深度工作进行计时。到一天结束的时候，借助这张纸就可以复盘今天做了哪些深度工作、工作了多长时间。很多时候，脑子里形成了一个今天啥也没干的印象可能是因为今天没有干明确的有阶段性成果的活儿。但是当你理性地细数今天做了哪些事时，你很有可能会发现，这些事是对于在明天、后天取得成果非常重要的基础工作，它们是非常有价值的。这样一来，你就可以基于客观的事实，给自己更公平的评价，可以更好地认可自己的努力。</p>
            <p class="en">Second, it helps me more objectively understand my daily deep work hours and helps me acknowledge my daily efforts. If you're also someone who tends to be a bit harsh on yourself and often questions yourself for wasting another day, then a timer might be very helpful for you. Often, this self-criticism comes from thoughts that deviate from facts rather than from the facts themselves. As mentioned earlier, I write down what I want to do on a piece of paper and time the deep work among these tasks. At the end of the day, with this paper, I can review what deep work I did and how long I worked. Often, the impression that you didn't do anything today might be because you didn't complete any tasks with clear milestone achievements. But when you rationally count what you did today, you're likely to find that these tasks were crucial foundational work for achieving results tomorrow or the day after - they were very valuable. This way, you can give yourself a fairer evaluation based on objective facts and better acknowledge your efforts.</p>

            <p class="cn">另一方面，关于深度工作的时长，也不必对自己过于苛刻。对于脑力工作者而言，如果是上班的一天，8个小时能有4个小时的深度工作，那已经是非常卓有成效的一天了，因为会有大量的时间是花在像开会、回消息、处理流程性事项等浅工作上。可能一天能有两三个小时的深度工作，就已经是不错的水平了。一般而言，但凡开始了深度工作，就很难低于一两个小时。所以如果在属于自己的一天里，你开展了任何一项深度工作，大概率是会达到两个小时的，这就已经相当于一个工作日的深度工作的水平了。如果剩下的时间你在玩耍并且玩得开心的话，那么这就是有高质量地度过时光的美好一天。总之，要多找机会表扬自己，自我否定并非行动力的可靠来源，自我肯定才是。在设定目标的时候，尽量降低开始做事的门槛，让事情看上去容易做，才能做得更多。</p>
            <p class="en">On the other hand, regarding the duration of deep work, you shouldn't be too harsh on yourself. For knowledge workers, if on a workday you can achieve 4 hours of deep work out of 8 hours, that's already a highly productive day, because a lot of time is spent on shallow work like meetings, responding to messages, and handling procedural matters. Having two to three hours of deep work in a day is already a good level. Generally, once you start deep work, it's rarely less than an hour or two. So if in your own day, you engage in any deep work, it's likely to reach two hours, which is equivalent to a workday's worth of deep work. If you spend the remaining time playing and enjoying yourself, that's a high-quality, well-spent day. In short, find more opportunities to praise yourself - self-negation isn't a reliable source of motivation, self-affirmation is. When setting goals, try to lower the threshold for starting tasks, make things appear easier to do, and you'll end up doing more.</p>

            <p class="cn">接下来我会具体介绍我是如何使用A5白纸来进行日程管理的，并说明这么做的好处。</p>
            <p class="en">Next, I'll specifically introduce how I use A5 paper for schedule management and explain the benefits of this approach.</p>

            <p class="cn">在介绍使用A5白纸的具体操作前，我需要先定义一下我"日程管理"的优化目标——释放大脑内存，尽可能让每一分脑力专注于当下的任务，避免注意力的耗散和漂移。我会基于这个目标来灵活地做每个具体的决策。比如，我并不会固定在一天开始或结束的时候列待办事项。因为在有些日子，我会非常明确的知道今天有一件将会整段整段地占据我的时间和注意力的"大事"要办。在这种情况下，但凡想一点其它的杂七杂八的事，都算是对我注意力的分散。我需要保护起床后纯净的注意力，要把全部的精神都集中在这一件大事上，所以我完全不会列待办。直到把这个大事情做完，我才会着眼规划其它的杂项。另外，在晚上列待办同样也是不适合我的工作方式。我试过几次，每一次都会影响睡眠。这是由于在晚上列待办会分走我本应该专注于休息的精力，基于我的优化目标，我也完全不会采取这个策略。那我在什么时候写待办呢？一种情况是我脑子里充斥着各种想做的事的时候，基于释放大脑内存的原则，我会把它们写在纸上，这样我就不用在脑子里运行一个后台程序来记住它们。一个类似的情况是当我在专注干一件事时，脑子里冒出来的想干的另一件事，我也会迅速地把它写在纸上。这对我而言是释放大脑内存、让注意力回到当前任务的最快的方式。如果是使用手机笔记APP来记录，那我将走一个长长的链条：找到手机→找到APP→找到相应笔记条目或新建一条笔记→记录。相对于在纸上记的直接而言，这么做更耗时，阻力也更大，更容易导致注意力的分散，更难把注意力拉回来。如果不采用纸笔记录的话，我可能会为了避免被手机打扰而选择信任自己的工作记忆，即开一个后台程序来记住这个事儿，这同样是分散注意力的。可能有朋友会说，手机很方便呀，做一条简单的记录可能一分钟就搞定了，但是写在纸上可能只要三秒。读到这里你可能也发现了，我是一个相对严格的注意力保卫者，我觉得三秒和一分钟的注意力漂移区别非常大。其实我选择使用纸来做记录而不是使用各种时间管理APP、清单APP的逻辑和选择使用实体的计时器而不是电子设备中的计时软件一样，因为这样交互更直接、更不容易分心、更不占大脑内存、可以有效避免电子设备带来的消极情绪体验。</p>
            <p class="en">Before introducing the specific operation of using A5 paper, I need to first define my optimization goal for "schedule management" - freeing up mental RAM, allowing every bit of mental energy to focus on the current task, and avoiding attention dissipation and drift. I make each specific decision flexibly based on this goal. For example, I don't have a fixed time at the beginning or end of the day to list to-dos. Because on some days, I know very clearly that there's a "big task" that will occupy my time and attention in chunks. In such cases, thinking about any other miscellaneous things counts as a distraction. I need to protect my pure attention after waking up and concentrate all my energy on this one big thing, so I won't make any to-do lists at all. Only after completing this big task will I look at planning other miscellaneous items. Additionally, making to-do lists at night doesn't suit my working style either. I've tried it several times, and each time it affected my sleep. This is because making to-do lists at night takes away energy that should be focused on rest, and based on my optimization goal, I won't adopt this strategy at all. So when do I write to-dos? One situation is when my mind is filled with various things I want to do; based on the principle of freeing up mental RAM, I write them down on paper so I don't have to run a background process in my mind to remember them. A similar situation is when I'm focusing on one task and another task pops into my mind; I quickly write it down on paper too. For me, this is the fastest way to free up mental RAM and bring attention back to the current task. If I were to use a phone note app to record, I would go through a long chain: find the phone → find the app → find the corresponding note entry or create a new note → record. Compared to writing directly on paper, this takes more time, has more resistance, is more likely to cause distraction, and makes it harder to bring attention back. If I don't use paper and pen to record, I might choose to trust my working memory to avoid being disturbed by the phone, meaning running a background process to remember this thing, which is equally distracting. Some friends might say that phones are convenient, and making a simple record might only take a minute, but writing on paper might only take three seconds. Reading this, you might have realized that I'm a relatively strict attention guardian; I think there's a very big difference between three seconds and one minute of attention drift. Actually, my logic for choosing to use paper for recording rather than various time management apps and list apps is the same as choosing to use a physical timer rather than timing software on electronic devices - because this way the interaction is more direct, less distracting, occupies less mental RAM, and can effectively avoid the negative emotional experiences brought by electronic devices.</p>

            <p class="cn">除此之外，使用纸笔还有一个额外的好处。我上学的大部分阶段是不咋依赖电子设备来辅助学习的，全是手写的笔记。可能从人生早期开始建立的、并且在之后不断得到增强的一个脑回路是——拿起笔时我才能更好地思考。我一直都很难读得下去电子书，我也尝试过各种笔记APP，复制粘贴看起来很方便，但是我觉得电子版的笔记很难在我心中留下深刻的印象，即便是自己一个字一个字打的也远没有手写的效果好。最近我开始大量做手写笔记后，发现我确实记得更牢了，这或许是因为我用拿起笔写字的方式，激活了我更擅长、也更有效的学习模式。</p>
            <p class="en">Additionally, using pen and paper has another benefit. Throughout most of my schooling, I didn't rely much on electronic devices for learning - all my notes were handwritten. Perhaps a neural pathway established early in life and continuously reinforced is that I can think better when I pick up a pen. I've always found it difficult to read e-books, and I've tried various note-taking apps. While copy-and-paste seems convenient, I find that electronic notes rarely leave a lasting impression on me, even when I type them character by character - it's far less effective than handwriting. Recently, after starting to take extensive handwritten notes, I've found that I indeed remember things better, perhaps because the act of picking up a pen and writing activates my more proficient and effective learning mode.</p>

            <p class="cn">下面我会介绍一些使用纸列日程的具体操作细节。首先，我选择A5大小的纸是因为这相对于我字的大小、我需要列的任务量而言是一个比较合适的尺寸。这个大小也足够显眼（Yo，又一个"显眼包"闪亮登场了），把它放在工作桌上不被遮挡的地方，一天之内我能看到它很多次，这便于在我思想开小差的时候，提醒我把注意力拉回来，优先把单子上的事给办了。因为它不会说话，不会叨叨叨叨，所以它的提醒也不会很强势（A kind and gentle reminder）。要满足上述几个需求，A4、B5对我来说太大，便利贴又太小，所以我选择了A5，大家可以根据自己的情况选择合适大小的纸。另外，可以固定放一沓纸在桌上，这样就不用每次要用的时候再找。我们的基本原则就是降低做事的难度，降低阻力，让交互变得直接。一般我会用纸的上半部分列任务，用下半部分记录一下做事的感受和体会，比如可以怎样优化日程的安排呀、今天因为什么事情分心了以后可以采取什么策略避免呀、哪些事给我带来了正面感受以后可以多安排呀等等。还有一点补充是，我倾向于不为每个任务规划具体的时间段。因为大量的任务都是独特的、未知的，我无法预知我要花多少时间，不管是自己还是别人规定我要在多少时间内完成都会让我觉得有束缚感。想想生命中有多少事是以我完全意想不到的方式解决的，我就很难从理性上接受预先规定一个我不了解的事要在xx时间内完成是合理的。最后，我想解释一下我推荐使用纸而不是日程本的原因。虽然纸和日程本都是实体的，但是日程本需要人主动翻开，如果不是活页本那种可以方便平展的形式，就多了一个交互的步骤，也不方便做"显眼包"来提醒自己拉回注意力。从原理上来说，大小合适的、可以平展的活页本也是不错的选择。</p>
            <p class="en">Now I'll introduce some specific operational details about using paper for scheduling. First, I chose A5-sized paper because it's a suitable size relative to my handwriting and the number of tasks I need to list. This size is also sufficiently noticeable (Yo, another "obvious package" makes its debut), and when placed in an unobstructed spot on my desk, I can see it many times throughout the day. This helps bring my attention back when my mind wanders, reminding me to prioritize the tasks on the list. Because it doesn't speak or nag, its reminders aren't overpowering (A kind and gentle reminder). To meet these requirements, A4 and B5 are too large for me, while sticky notes are too small, so I chose A5 - everyone can choose the appropriate size based on their situation. Additionally, you can keep a stack of paper fixed on your desk, so you don't have to search for it every time you need it. Our basic principle is to reduce the difficulty of doing things, reduce resistance, and make interactions direct. I typically use the upper half of the paper to list tasks and the lower half to record feelings and reflections about doing the tasks, such as how to optimize schedule arrangements, what strategies to avoid distractions that occurred today, which activities brought positive feelings and should be scheduled more often, etc. Another point to add is that I tend not to plan specific time slots for each task. Because many tasks are unique and unknown, I can't predict how much time they'll take, and whether it's self-imposed or externally imposed, having to complete something within a set time feels constraining. Thinking about how many things in life are resolved in completely unexpected ways, I find it hard to rationally accept that pre-determining a completion time for something I don't fully understand is reasonable. Finally, I want to explain why I recommend using paper rather than a planner. While both are physical objects, a planner needs to be actively opened, and unless it's a loose-leaf type that can lie flat easily, it adds an extra interaction step and isn't as convenient for serving as an "obvious package" to bring back attention. In principle, a properly sized, lay-flat loose-leaf notebook is also a good choice.</p>

            <p class="cn">说到使用纸来规划日程的好处，前面已经直接、间接提到很多了。或许它的核心就在于帮助你更有意识地使用自己的时间，而不是被各种外界的信息流牵着鼻子走。在纸上写下任务，按下计时器开始做的时候，其实就是在宣告，"我决定接下来的时间要深入投入到xx事上"，是"我"把握主动权做的决定，而不是滑到哪里算哪里、浑浑噩噩地虚度了光阴。很多你列在纸上的事，可能今天不一定能完成，但是把它们记录下来很重要，因为这在一定程度上反映了你内心的需求，其中有一些事可能是你喜欢做的事，但你一直感到找不到时间去做。你可以把它们规划到以后的日程中，这样它们的优先级就会高于无意识地滑手机等浪费时间的活动，你将真真正正地安排时间去落实它们，这将带给你幸福感。另外，真的也不必对自己过于苛刻。不算睡觉的8小时，在剩下的16个小时中能有一半的时间进行真正的深度工作（不包含浅工作）就是非常非常了不起的水平了，所以在另一半的时间中偶尔神游也不必过于介怀。</p>
            <p class="en">Speaking of the benefits of using paper for schedule planning, many have been mentioned directly and indirectly already. Perhaps its core value lies in helping you use your time more consciously, rather than being led by various external information flows. When you write down tasks on paper and press the timer to start, you're essentially declaring, "I've decided to deeply invest my upcoming time in this specific task" - it's "me" taking control of the decision, rather than mindlessly drifting and wasting time. Many things you list on paper might not be completed today, but recording them is important because it somewhat reflects your inner needs - some might be things you enjoy doing but feel you never have time for. You can plan them into future schedules, giving them priority over time-wasting activities like mindless phone scrolling, and you'll truly arrange time to implement them, which will bring you happiness. Also, you really shouldn't be too harsh on yourself. Not counting 8 hours of sleep, if you can spend half of the remaining 16 hours doing real deep work (not including shallow work), that's already an incredibly impressive level, so don't worry too much about occasionally zoning out during the other half.</p>

            <p class="cn">我在时间管理上走过很多弯路，尝试过很多不同的记录时间、管理时间的APP，但是都很难长期使用。从前几年读 《奇特的一生》了解到柳比歇夫的时间统计法后，我就在试图寻找一个方便我统计时间的APP，但每一个APP我都不满意，原因可能在于要在脑子里挂着一个别忘了记录时间的后台程序让我觉得很不舒服，也可能是要更频繁接触手机带来的那种隐约的焦虑感。对于我而言，这些APP给我带来的负担感大于好处。绕了一大圈，我发现还是纸和笔最适合我，我和它们相处愉快，这也是柳比歇夫在他那个年代记录时间的方式。我想这些体验是很个人的，或许可以共享的教训是，停止花时间找最优解。我想拥有最好交互方式的笔记APP、日程APP暂时还没有被开发出来，但我相信随着取代手机的变革性的交互方式的出现，它们也会很快出现。在此之前，用笨办法反而会比较快。我没有在一开始选择用纸和笔来记录时间仅仅是因为这么做不能自动统计时间。其实每天算一下当天深度工作了几小时也要不了一分钟，按月、按年统计一次可能也要不了几小时。反而搜罗各种软件、熟悉如何使用它们可能会浪费很多时间。如果你也有一款你不太满意的时间管理APP，或许你也可以考虑使用某种"笨办法"来完成你不太满意的点，而不是花时间寻找一款"更完美"的APP。</p>
            <p class="en">I've taken many detours in time management, trying various apps for recording and managing time, but found them all difficult to use long-term. After learning about Lyubishchev's time tracking method from reading "This Strange Life" a few years ago, I tried to find a convenient time-tracking app, but wasn't satisfied with any of them. Perhaps it was because having to keep a background process in my mind to remember to record time felt uncomfortable, or maybe it was the subtle anxiety from more frequent phone interactions. For me, the burden of these apps outweighed their benefits. After a long journey, I discovered that pen and paper suit me best, and I enjoy working with them - this was also Lyubishchev's method in his era. I think these experiences are very personal, but perhaps the shared lesson is to stop spending time looking for the optimal solution. I believe the note-taking and scheduling apps with the best interaction methods haven't been developed yet, but I'm confident they'll appear soon with the emergence of revolutionary interaction methods that replace phones. Until then, using the "primitive" method might actually be faster. I didn't choose pen and paper initially simply because they couldn't automatically track time. Actually, calculating daily deep work hours takes less than a minute, and monthly or yearly statistics might only take a few hours. In contrast, collecting various software and learning how to use them might waste much more time. If you also have a time management app you're not quite satisfied with, perhaps you could consider using some "primitive" method to address your dissatisfaction, rather than spending time searching for a "more perfect" app.</p>

            <p class="en">Finally, this article is about one person finding an operating system that works for them - it's definitely not the "right" answer. I hope everyone can find their own suitable approach and enjoy a pleasant relationship with time.</p>
