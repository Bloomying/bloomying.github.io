                <p>Welcome to my art exhibition "Bloomying", a play on my name, Ying. I love the coincidence of the pronunciation of my name with "ing", so I coined "Bloomying" as the name of this exhibition to convey "Ying is blooming" doing art.</p>
                
                <p>I come from a math and statistics background, worked as an image algorithm engineer and deep learning practitioner, and now I explore the beautiful intersection of art and technology - where mathematical precision meets artistic intuition, where code dances with creativity.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Two years ago, when I decided to become an artist, I couldn't imagine what I would create — all I had was the faith and determination for my artist dream.</p>
                
                <p>Now, I have a whole website filled with diverse works across various mediums, from delicate heat shrink crafts to code-generated patterns, from traditional Chinese brush paintings to iPad digital illustrations, from AI fashion designs to interactive experiences, from captured moments in photography to experimental video art.</p>
                
                <p>You can explore them by themes (including "Blooming with Pride", "My Vigor. My Heartbeat.", and "My Fantasy. My Dreamland.") or by mediums (including digital paintings, photography, code-based art, crafts, traditional Chinese brush painting, AI art, video art, music, and writing).</p>
                
                <p>I am amazed by how creativity unfolds when we dare to follow our inner calling. This journey validates my philosophy: when we believe in the existence of a beautiful world, it comes into being. Through this belief, I've truly transformed my dream into reality.</p>

                <p>Through countless hours creating visual arts, crafts, music, and numerous experiments across different mediums, I have found passion and vitality in life. Whether solving mathematical problems, developing innovative algorithms for technical challenges, or making art - to me, they're all like engaging puzzle games. Perhaps life's most important puzzle is ourselves, and our most essential task is to understand and continually refine who we are. In my life, technology and art are not opposing forces; rather, they are complementary languages that decode the greatest mystery of life: ourselves.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most profound artwork we can create is our own life - having the courage to recognize and nurture our gifts, to follow our inner calling, and to find joy in authentic self-expression. Through my creative practice, I hope to inspire others to embark on their own journey of self-discovery and creation.</p>

                    <p class="work-description">A serendipitous capture on my way home, a surprise gift from randomness. Walking in a light drizzle after watching a movie, singing along to "Tian Hei Hei" with an empty soda bottle as percussion, I captured this slightly blurry yet beautifully imperfect moment of pink flowers by the path. Despite multiple attempts later, I could never recreate this shot - perhaps a testament to the unique beauty of spontaneous moments.</p>

                    <h3 class="work-title">Illuminated</h3>
                    <p class="work-description">"Illuminated" is my first iPad painting and marks the beginning of my artistic journey. I remember that night - feeling a bit down, I picked up my iPad and started making random strokes. Gradually, I found myself completely immersed in the creative process, as the world around me seemed to fade into peaceful silence. Hours passed unnoticed until nearly 2 AM, when exhaustion finally pulled me away from the screen. This simple act of creation, lasting just a few hours, filled me with an energy that radiated through the following days.</p>
                    <p class="work-description">The piece captures an interplay of light and shadow, as if illuminating darkness itself - a reflection of my own state that night, finding light within shadows. The title "Illuminated" carries dual meaning: both the visual effect of light breaking through darkness in the painting, and the moment my life itself was illuminated by rediscovering art.</p>
                    <p class="work-description">This piece represents more than just a painting; it's the spark that ignited my artistic path. From this moment on, I felt my life being lit up with new purpose and possibility.</p>

                    <p class="work-description">This piece serves as the landing page video, welcoming visitors with its mesmerizing fluidity. It symbolizes how creativity, like sunlight, creates ripples that spread outward, touching and transforming everything in their path.

                            Of colors flowing endlessly
                            Every sketch beneath my bed
                            Every song inside my head
                            Wasn't just a passing phase
                            But my soul trying to say
                            
                            Tried to fit into their world
                            Oh, how many times I failed
                            Till I learned this simple truth:
                            Some hearts can't be contained
                            
                            Now I know with open eyes
                            I was born with colors in my soul
                            And melodies that had to flow
                            Art's not what I chose to do
                            It's the air I breathe, it's true
                            Though I learned this truth so late
                            Every detour had its place
                            Now I understand at last
                            Why my heart beats this way
                            
                            They say I feel too much, too deep
                            But that's what makes my art sing
                            Success they said would set me free
                            But chains of gold still felt like chains
                            The path they chose felt like a cage
                            Though lined with golden praise
                            But art kept calling through the years
                            Like sunlight through the haze
                            
                            No more loving from afar
                            Other artists' distant stars
                            Time to turn that love within
                            Let my own light begin
                            Through the darkness and through the light
                            I've got worlds left to create
                            With melancholy and with joy
                            This is who I'm meant to be
                            An artist, finally me
                            
                            Every color, every line
                            Tells the story that is mine
                            Like a river finding sea
                            I'm becoming who I'm meant to be
                            Watch me paint across the sky
                            With colors only I define
                            This is where I'm meant to be
                            An artist, wild and free
