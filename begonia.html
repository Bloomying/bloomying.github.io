                    偶然在b站看到@末芥绿的没骨画，觉得很喜欢，就买了她写的《没骨花卉日课》学习，这幅画临摹自其中的秋海棠。好久不拿毛笔，也没练习过这么精细的笔触，还是大胆尝试了一下。画的过程有些挑战，总体上还是很享受的。

                    之前学过几年写意，在画室里度过了数不清的周末和寒暑。在那些整日画画的时光里，我永远平静、愉悦、专注。我永远沉浸在当下的时光中，享受这一刻的生命。

                    记得有一天下了特别特别大的雪，我按时来到画室门口，发现竟然没有开门，原来那天只有我一个人去了。那时候做很多事情都是这样，风雨无阻，在别人口中的我"刻苦"、"有毅力"。只有我自己知道，所谓的"坚持"是出于纯粹的喜欢，雨雪天也从来不曾让我挣扎。踩水时就体验水的触感，鞋子湿掉就体验它慢慢从湿变干的感觉，所有的这些事情本身对于我来说都是中性的，它不意味着好也不意味着坏，自然也不和负面情绪挂钩。可是长大之后，我还要通过学习积极心理学才能重新明白这一点——感受不取决于事情本身，而是取决于我们对事情的解读。或许我一直都拥有这些生命的礼物吧，怎么长大了反而把它们弄丢了。或许后来脑子里有的很多关于什么是痛苦的概念，是被外界构建的，并不来自于我们自身的感受和体验。或许，前人的经验在帮我们规避风险的同时，也让我们预设了痛苦。在未曾踏足的土地上，一切依旧充满新奇和未知。

                    懵懂和迟钝曾经保护了我，让我可以全身心地活在自己的体验中，在大部分时候都做个无忧无虑的快乐小孩。可是现在长大了，童话结束了，世界很嘈杂，各种各样的声音通过网络飞快来到我的身边，他人言语构建的世界看上去也那么真实，人们描述的那些痛苦和快乐，我似乎也能想象和感同身受。可另一方面，这些声音似乎也对我线下的真实生活空间造成了挤压，影响了我对具体生活的感受和判断。不由得想起Sufjan Stevens的Death with Dignity中的一句歌词，Is it real or a fable？我想事情本不该这样，应该带着一颗澄澈的心一猛子扎进生活里，自己第一手的体验和感受才是最真实和鲜活的，也是最重要的。

                <div class="story-text-en">
                    I recently discovered @MoJieLv's "boneless" painting style on Bilibili and was immediately drawn to it. I purchased her book "Daily Lessons in Boneless Flower Painting" and attempted this begonia, which is copied from one of her works. Though I haven't held a brush in a long time and never practiced such delicate brushwork before, I decided to give it a try. While challenging, the process was thoroughly enjoyable.

                    I previously studied freehand painting for several years, spending countless weekends and holidays in the art studio. During those days filled with painting, I was always calm, joyful, and focused. I was forever immersed in the present moment, savoring each instant of life.

                    I remember one day when it snowed heavily. I arrived at the studio on time only to find it closed - I was the only one who had shown up that day. Back then, I approached many things this way, rain or shine. Others called me "hardworking" and "persistent." Only I knew that this so-called "persistence" came from pure love - rain and snow never made me hesitate. When stepping in water, I simply experienced its sensation; when my shoes got wet, I observed the feeling of them slowly drying. All these experiences were neutral to me - neither good nor bad - and thus never connected to negative emotions. Yet as I grew up, I had to relearn this through positive psychology - that our feelings don't depend on circumstances themselves, but on how we interpret them. Perhaps I always possessed these gifts of life but somehow lost them as I grew older. Maybe many of our concepts about what constitutes suffering are constructed by the outside world, rather than coming from our own feelings and experiences. Perhaps while helping us avoid risks, the experiences of others also preset our expectations of pain. On untrodden ground, everything remains full of wonder and unknown possibilities.

                    My naivety and obtuseness once protected me, allowing me to live fully in my own experiences, being a carefree, happy child most of the time. But now that I'm grown up, the fairy tale has ended. The world is noisy, with various voices quickly reaching me through the internet. The world constructed by others' words seems so real - I can imagine and empathize with the pain and joy they describe. However, these voices seem to have compressed my offline living space, affecting how I perceive and judge my actual life. It reminds me of a lyric from Sufjan Stevens' "Death with Dignity": "Is it real or a fable?" I don't think things should be this way. We should dive into life with a clear heart - our firsthand experiences and feelings are the most real, vivid, and important.
